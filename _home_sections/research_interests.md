**AI in Medical Imaging, Deep Learning and Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Computing Medicine**

Obtained a machine learning degree in medical school, I've been focusing on cross-domain researches at machine learning and medical imaging in interdisciplinary groups. Not only for improving accuracy and generalisability of general purpose computer vision application, such as, cross-modal image synthesis, segmentation, registration, data fusion, quantification, lesion and pathology detection, reconstruction but also computer aided diagnosis, therapy planning, and surgical robotic perception, which can be immediately applied to real ongoing clinical research projects. I have expertise in deep learning for multi-modality medical image computing, especially for **brain**, **coronary artery**, **cardiac data** and retina data. I've been involved in or lead the machine learning research for over 12 clinical trials.

Recently, I widely investigate the problems of meta learning, model generalisation and invertible machine learning models for medical scenarios.
