**Machine Learning in Medicine Data Analysis, Computational Healthcare, Internet of Things**

I focus on frontier technology of machine learning applicable to medical data analysis and clinical decision making. This involves object detection, segmentation and quantification in medical images, and merging multi-modal (e.g., **image, genetic and molecular** data), simulation, cross-domain synthesis, life-long learning for automatic diagnosis and treatment planning with imperfect data. I have expertise in deep learning with multi-modal and high-dimensional medical data. 

Recently, I widely investigate the problems of interpretability and generalizability of deep learning models that reached a status of Pareto Optimality, and applicability of deep neural networks in the complete clinical decision pipeline.
