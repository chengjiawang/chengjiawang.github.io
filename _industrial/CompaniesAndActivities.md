title: Cross-modality brain image synthesis using DicycleGAN
order: 1
permalink: #dicyclegan-brain
---
A new deformation-invariant GAN model (DicycleGAN), training from unpaired and unregistered images, output aligned data.
* Novel architecture based on deformable convolution and thin-plate-spline
* New alignment-based cycle-consistent loss
* A wide range of potential applications, e.g., synthesis of development of Alzheimer's disease
