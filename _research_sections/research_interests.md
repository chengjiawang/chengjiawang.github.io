 Medical Image Analysis, Deep Learning, Machine Learning.

I focus on interdisciplinary researches at medical image analysis and artificial intelligence, for improving lesion detection, anatomical structure segmentation and quantification, cancer diagnosis and therapy, and surgical robotic perception. I have expertise in 3D deep learning for high-dimensional medical image computing.

Recently, I widely investigate model generalization and robustness related topics in machine learning for medical scenarios.
