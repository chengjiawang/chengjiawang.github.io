The deep learning based inverse-consistent registration model
* To the best of our knowledge, we are the first:
  * Deep learning based inverse-consistent multi-modality registration model that has been tested on 3D data (smaller network size than disentangled structure)
  * Deep learning model outperform the state-of-the-art and classic "SyN" method on difficult registration problems
  * SIMULTANEOUS joint training for cross-modal synthesis and registration
