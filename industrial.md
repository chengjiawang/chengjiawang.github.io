## **How and Why**
This was in FAQ. But I recently realised this need to be clarified first in any situation. Two points first.

1. I am a full time machine learning researcher, which means I focus on academic work >=9 hours per day including (except some permitted holidays). My experiences outside the academy include **technology transfer** and **commercialisation**, and **course development**. (Details given [below]). In a word, connecting the academic, industrial and financial sectors. This is about my philosophy about research, about understanding how the private/industrial funding body works, and about how to guide these resources back to support research (for example, efficient locating industrial funding for a research project).

2. With a few years of experiences, I am now fully qualified to work in private invest funds by passing the assessment of Asset Management Association of China (**AMAC certificate no.201810428875630042 and 201810428800184042**, photocopies available on request).
